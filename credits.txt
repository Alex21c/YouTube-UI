Back in 2006, i was in 9th standard when i got an opportunity to learn computers in govt high school in my hometown Sunder Nagar H.P. i remember designing my first web page back then on windows 98 Operating system on a thick CRT monitor with a Mechanical mouse (having ball inside).
it was just plain html page with inline styles like text and background color along with text bold and italic formatting with an fruits image i have drawn using microsoft paint.

after completing my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Himachal Pradesh University back in 2014, I learnt from online tutorials Full Stack Web development using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP5, MySql, Apache Web Server, and made lots of projects including Amazon Affiliate website. back then i was lacking self confidence in myself, and lacking vision, although i was hard working, willing to learn new things, but lack of vision and self-confidence shackled my feets.

In 2017 after completing my M.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Punjab Technical University, i joined private university in my hometown as an Assistance professor in department of Computer Science Engineering and taught more than 2000 students there computer fundamentals, core computer science engineering subjects along with programming. i worked there for 3 full years till 2021, when i started my own business with help from my parents!

life have once again brought me where i started back in 2006, with my first HTML webpage on that Windows 98 computer at government high school in my hometown.

This time, i have tested my limits, have self confidence and vision. From last three days i was working on Geekster project on HTML5 and CSS3, i was required to make YouTube User interface clone, i did my best and here are the glimpse of the final product, have a look at it with smile on yours face!
